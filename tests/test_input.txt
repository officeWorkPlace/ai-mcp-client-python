1. Loan product popularity
Objective: Identify the loan types most frequently used and analyze trends in new loan applications over time.
Section 	Recommended content
Popularity overview	A summary table listing all loan types (e.g., mortgages, personal loans, business loans), their total application count, and their total approved loan amount for a given period.
Key highlights	Use a bulleted list to call out the most popular and fastest-growing loan products. For example:"Personal loans represent 45% of total applications.""Demand for small business loans has increased by 15% this quarter."
Trend analysis	Visual: A line chart showing the monthly or quarterly volume of new applications, segmented by loan type. This highlights product seasonality and growth trends.
Narrative: Interpret the chart, explaining significant spikes or dips in application volume. For example, correlate an increase in mortgage applications with a drop in interest rates.

2. Branch lending performance
Objective: Compare total loan amounts and number of loans issued by each branch.
Section 	Recommended content
Performance dashboard	A high-level, dashboard-style view comparing key metrics for all branches in a single table, with sorting functionality. Include metrics such as:Total loan amount originatedTotal number of loans issuedApproval rate (%)Average processing time (days)
Top and bottom performers	Visual: Bar charts ranking the top 5 and bottom 5 branches based on total loans issued and total value originated.
Narrative: An analysis section identifying standout branches. This can include explanations for a branch's success, such as location or a particular market focus.
Efficiency metrics	A comparative view of branches' approval rates and average processing times. This helps identify best practices that can be shared across the organization.

3. Customer segmentation
Objective: Group customers by key attributes and analyze default rates by segment for risk management.
Section 	Recommended content
Segment definitions	Define the criteria for each customer segment (e.g., high credit score, high income, specific loan type). For instance, a "high-value" segment might be defined as customers with a credit score above 750 and an income over $100,000.
Segment profile	For each defined segment, provide key statistics like:Average loan amountMost popular loan productsAverage credit scoreDefault rate (%)
Risk analysis	Visual: A heat map or bar chart comparing the default rates across all customer segments.
Narrative: Interpret the risk data. For example, "The low-income, unsecured personal loan segment has the highest default rate and requires tighter underwriting".

4. Interest rate impact
Objective: Assess how changes in interest rates affect loan uptake and repayment behavior.
Section 	Recommended content
Rate trends vs. application volume	Visual: A dual-axis line chart plotting average interest rates over time against new loan application volumes. This can help visualize their correlation.
Narrative: A summary of the observed correlation. For instance, "A 50 basis point increase in the average interest rate is correlated with a 10% decrease in new applications."
Impact on repayments	A breakdown comparing repayment behavior (e.g., late payments, delinquencies) during periods of high vs. low interest rates. For variable-rate loans, track changes in monthly payments.
Competitive rate analysis	A table comparing your average interest rates across different loan types and customer profiles against competitor averages, if available.

5. Risk assessment trends
Objective: Track risk scores and recommended actions for loan applications.
Section 	Recommended content
Overall risk profile	Visual: A histogram showing the distribution of risk scores for all new applications. This shows the overall health of the applicant pool.
Narrative: A summary discussing trends in risk scores, such as an increasing number of high-risk applicants over the last six months.
Risk categories and outcomes	A table categorizing applications by risk score (e.g., low, medium, high) and their ultimate outcome (approved, rejected, defaulted).
Action plan analysis	A summary of recommended actions based on risk scores (e.g., require more collateral for high-risk applications) and the effectiveness of those actions.

6. Audit and compliance
Objective: Monitor audit log activity for unusual changes or frequent updates to sensitive tables.
Section 	Recommended content
Executive summary	A high-level overview detailing the audit period, key findings, and significant risks identified.
Unusual activity log	Visual: A timeline chart showing all changes made to sensitive data, such as loan terms or customer records. Highlight unusual spikes in activity.
Narrative: A detailed log of unusual activities, including the user who made the change, the timestamp, and the specific data that was altered.
User behavior analysis	A summary of change activity broken down by user or department. For example, a report could flag a user who made an unusually high number of changes to sensitive loan accounts.

7. Payment behavior
Objective: Analyze payment timeliness, late fees, and repayment schedules.
Section 	Recommended content
Payment timeliness	Visual: A line chart tracking the percentage of on-time payments over time, with annotations for key events or policy changes.
Narrative: A summary highlighting trends in late payments and the impact of late fees.
Late payment analysis	A detailed breakdown of customers or loan types with frequent late payments. Identify potential root causes, such as loan size, interest rates, or customer segment.
